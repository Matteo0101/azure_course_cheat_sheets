# Prepare to Use the AI Content Understanding REST API

## Problem
You need to connect a client application to the Azure AI Content Understanding REST API. How do you provision the necessary resources and retrieve the required connection details?

## Solution with Azure
Provision an **Azure AI Services multi-service resource** either directly via the Azure portal or by creating an **Azure AI Foundry hub**, which includes the necessary services by default. Then, retrieve the **endpoint** and **API key** to authenticate and interact with the REST API.

## Required Components
- **Azure AI Services resource**
- **Azure AI Foundry hub** (optional, includes AI Services resource)
- **Azure portal** or **Azure AI Foundry portal**
- **API key** and **endpoint URL**

## Architecture / Development
1. **Provision the Resource**:
   - Option 1: Create an Azure AI Services resource in the Azure portal.
   - Option 2: Create an Azure AI Foundry hub, which includes the AI Services resource.

2. **Retrieve Connection Details**:
   - From the Azure portal: Navigate to the AI Services resource to get the endpoint and API key.
   - From Azure AI Foundry: Access the project settings to retrieve the same information.

3. **Programmatic Access**:
   - Use the **Azure AI Foundry SDK** with Microsoft Entra ID authentication to connect to the project and retrieve the endpoint and key programmatically.

## Best Practices / Considerations
- Use **Azure AI Foundry** for a visual interface and integrated project management.
- Ensure your subscription and region support the required services.
- Securely store and manage API keys using **Azure Key Vault**.
- Use **Microsoft Entra ID** for secure, role-based access when using the SDK.

## Exam-like Questions
1. What are two ways to provision an Azure AI Services resource for Content Understanding?
2. Where can you find the endpoint and API key for the Azure AI Services resource?
3. What is the benefit of using Azure AI Foundry over the Azure portal?
4. How can you programmatically retrieve connection details for the REST API?
5. Why is Microsoft Entra ID recommended when using the Azure AI Foundry SDK?



# Create a Content Understanding analyzer
In most scenarios, you should consider creating and testing analyzers using the visual interface in the Azure AI Foundry portal. However, in some cases you might want to create an analyzer by submitting a JSON definition of the schema for your desired content fields to the REST API.

## Defining a schema for an analyzer
Analyzers are based on schemas that define the fields you want to extract or generate from a content file. At its simplest, a schema is a set of fields, which can be specified in a JSON document, as shown in this example of an analyzer definition:
```python
{
    "description": "Simple business card",
    "baseAnalyzerId": "prebuilt-documentAnalyzer",
    "config": {
        "returnDetails": true
    },
    "fieldSchema": {
        "fields": {
            "ContactName": {
                "type": "string",
                "method": "extract",
                "description": "Name on business card"
            },
            "EmailAddress": {
                "type": "string",
                "method": "extract",
                "description": "Email address on business card"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example of a custom analyzer schema is based on the pre-built document analyzer, and describes two fields that you would expect to find on a business card: ContactName and EmailAddress. Both fields are defined as string data types, and are expected to be extracted from a document (in other words, the string values are expected to exist in the document so they can be "read"; rather than being fields that can be generated by inferring information about the document).

## Using the REST API to create an analyzer

With your analyzer definition in place, you can use the REST API to submit it to Azure AI Content Understanding to be created. The JSON data is submitted as a PUT request to the endpoint with the API key in the request header to start the analyzer creation operation.

The response from the PUT request includes a Operation-Location in the header, which provides a callback URL that you can use to check on the status of the request by submitting a GET request.

You can use any HTTP-capable client tool or language to submit the request. For example, the following Python code submits a request to create an analyzer based on the contents of a file named card.json (which is assumed to contain the JSON definition described previously)

```python
import json
import requests

# Get the buisness card schema
with open("card.json", "r") as file:
    schema_json = json.load(file)

# Use a PUT request to submit the schema for a new analyzer
analyzer_name = "business_card_analyser"

headers = {
    "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"}

url = f"{<YOUR_ENDPOINT>}/contentunderstanding/analyzers/{analyzer_name}?api-version=2025-05-01-preview"

response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(schema_json))

# Get the response and extract the ID assigned to the operation
callback_url = response.headers["Operation-Location"]

# Use a GET request to check the status of the operation
result_response = requests.get(callback_url, headers=headers)

# Keep polling until the operation is complete
status = result_response.json().get("status")
while status == "Running":
    result_response = requests.get(callback_url, headers=headers)
    status = result_response.json().get("status")

print("Done!")
```


# Analyze content

To analyze the contents of a file, you can use the Azure AI Content Understanding REST API to submit it to the endpoint using a POST request. You can specify the content as a URL (for a file hosted in an Internet-accessible location) or as the binary contents of the file (for example, a .pdf document, a .png image, an .mp3 audio file, or an .mp4 video file). The request header must include the API key, and the endpoint address for the analyze request includes the analyzer to be used.

As with the request to create an analyzer, the analyze request starts an asynchronous operation. The POST request returns a unique operation ID, which you can then use in a GET request to check the status of the analysis operation.

For example, suppose you want to use the business card analyzer discussed previously to extract the name and email address from the following scanned business card image:

Photograph of a business card for John Smith.

The following Python code submits a request for analysis, and then polls the service until the operation is complete and the results are returned.


```python
import json
import requests

# Read the image data
with open("business-card.png", "rb") as file:
        image_data = file.read()
    
## Use a POST request to submit the image data to the analyzer
analyzer_name = "business_card_analyser"

headers = {
        "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"}

url = f"{<YOUR_ENDPOINT>}/contentunderstanding/analyzers/{analyzer_name}:analyze?api-version=2025-05-01-preview"

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=image_data)

# Get the response and extract the ID assigned to the analysis operation
response_json = response.json()
id_value = response_json.get("id")

# Use a GET request to check the status of the analysis operation
result_url = f"{<YOUR_ENDPOINT>}/contentunderstanding/analyzerResults/{id_value}?api-version=2025-05-01-preview"

result_response = requests.get(result_url, headers=headers)

# Keep polling until the analysis is complete
status = result_response.json().get("status")
while status == "Running":
        result_response = requests.get(result_url, headers=headers)
        status = result_response.json().get("status")

# Get the analysis results
if status == "Succeeded":
    result_json = result_response.json()
```
## Processing analysis results

The results in the response JSON depend on:

The kind of content the analyzer is designed to analyze (for example, document, video, image, or audio).
The schema for the analyzer.
The contents of the file that was analyzed.
For example, the response from the document-based business card analyzer when analyzing the business card described previously contain:

The extracted fields
The optical character recognition (OCR) layout of the document, including locations of lines of text, individual words, and paragraphs on each page.
Here's the complete JSON response for the business card analysis:

```json
{
    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-a00000000000",
    "status": "Succeeded",

Your application must typically parse the JSON to retrieve field values. For example, the following python code extracts all of the string values:

```python
# (continued from previous code example)

# Iterate through the fields and extract the names and type-specific values
contents = result_json["result"]["contents"]
for content in contents:
    if "fields" in content:
        fields = content["fields"]
        for field_name, field_data in fields.items():
            if field_data['type'] == "string":
                print(f"{field_name}: {field_data['valueString']}")
```
The output from this code is shown here:
```python
ContactName: John Smith
EmailAddress: john@contoso.com
```
