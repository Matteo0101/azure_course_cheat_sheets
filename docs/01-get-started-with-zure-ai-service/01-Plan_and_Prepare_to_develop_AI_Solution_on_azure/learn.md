# Azure AI Solution Design Guide

## üîç Problem
You need to design and develop a comprehensive AI solution using Microsoft Azure, which involves choosing the right services, tools, and architectural patterns to support capabilities such as generative AI, computer vision, speech, and natural language processing ‚Äî while ensuring responsible AI practices.

## ‚úÖ Solution with Azure
Use **Azure AI services** and the **Azure AI Foundry platform** to plan, develop, and manage AI-powered applications. Foundry supports generative AI development, agent-based workflows, and orchestrations like Prompt Flow, enabling robust, scalable solutions.

## üß© Required Components
* **Azure AI Services**: Vision, Speech, Language, Translator, OpenAI, Document Intelligence, Content Safety, Face, Custom Vision
* **Azure AI Foundry** (portal + SDK)
* **Azure AI Hub (optional)** for advanced workflows
* **Development Tools**:
   * VS Code (local or container image in browser)
   * Azure CLI / Bicep / ARM for provisioning
   * GitHub + GitHub Copilot
* **SDKs and APIs**:
   * Azure AI Foundry SDK
   * Azure AI Services SDKs
   * Prompt Flow SDK
   * REST APIs

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture / Development

### Azure AI Foundry Structure
* **Foundry Projects**:
   * Centralize development of chat apps and agent-based solutions
   * Connect to Azure AI services
* **Hub-based Projects**:
   * Include managed compute, storage, key vault
   * Ideal for Prompt Flow, fine-tuning, multi-role teams (developers, data scientists)

### Provisioning Options
* **Single-service resources**: Ideal for small apps or evaluation (includes free tier)
* **Multi-service resource**: Easier management across services like OpenAI, Speech, Translator, Vision, etc.
* **Important**: Select the correct **Azure AI Services** resource type (üß† icon), not legacy Cognitive Services

### Developer Environments
* VS Code container (pre-configured for Foundry)
* Visual Studio / VS Code with GitHub integration
* SDKs available for: C#, Python, Node, Java, TypeScript

## ‚úÖ Best Practices / Considerations

### Responsible AI Principles (Microsoft):
* **Fairness**: Avoid bias, ensure representativity in training data
* **Reliability & Safety**: Use thresholds, validate confidence scores, rigorous testing
* **Privacy & Security**: Protect sensitive data during training/inference
* **Inclusiveness**: Diverse team input during development
* **Transparency**: Communicate system limitations, decision logic

### Additional Considerations:
* **Regional Availability**: Check availability per service/model
* **Cost Management**: Use pricing calculator and Foundry's centralized cost control
* **Quota Awareness**: Especially for VS Code compute containers and model usage
* **Tool Selection**: Match IDE and SDKs to your language and workflow preference

## ‚ùì Sample Exam Questions

**Q1**: You are planning to build an AI application that extracts key information from scanned receipts. Which Azure service should you use?
**A1**: Azure AI Document Intelligence

**Q2**: What is the benefit of using Azure AI Foundry instead of provisioning services individually?
**A2**: Centralized project/resource management, integrated portal + SDKs, simplified deployment of multi-service solutions

**Q3**: You need to develop a generative AI agent that can act autonomously based on prompts. What Azure components should you consider?
**A3**: Azure OpenAI (via Foundry), Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, optionally Prompt Flow SDK

**Q4**: A teammate wants to build a model fine-tuning workflow and securely store data and secrets. Which type of project is most suitable?
**A4**: Hub-based project in Azure AI Foundry

**Q5**: What is a key difference between the Azure AI services icon and the Azure Cognitive Services icon when provisioning in the portal?
**A5**: The Azure AI services icon provides access to the latest services (e.g., OpenAI, Content Understanding), while the older Cognitive Services icon does not.

**Q6**: Your development team prefers working in-browser and wants pre-configured SDKs. What is the recommended approach?
**A6**: Use the VS Code container image via Azure AI Foundry portal
