📌 **Problem**
You need to monitor, analyze, and control the usage and performance of Azure AI services to optimize cost, detect issues, and ensure service health.

✅ **Solution with Azure**
Use **Azure Monitor**, **Cost Management**, **Alert Rules**, **Diagnostic Logging**, and **Dashboards** to monitor usage, manage costs, and diagnose problems in Azure AI services.

🧩 **Required Components**
* Azure Pricing Calculator
* Azure Cost Management + Billing
* Azure Monitor
* Metrics and Alerts
* Azure Log Analytics workspace
* Azure Storage account
* Diagnostic settings configuration
* Azure Dashboards

🏗️ **Architecture / Development**

🧾 **Monitor costs**
* Use **Azure Pricing Calculator** to estimate costs before deployment.
   * Select service (e.g., Azure AI Language), region, tier, usage metrics.
   * Save/export estimate in Excel.
* Use **Cost Analysis** in Azure portal to monitor actual costs.
   * Apply filters to see only **Azure AI Services** usage.

🚨 **Create alerts**
* Navigate to your resource → **Alerts** tab → Add alert rule.
* Define:
   * **Scope**: AI service resource
   * **Condition**: Metric (e.g., error count) or Activity Log (e.g., key regeneration)
   * **Action**: Email, Logic App, etc.
   * **Alert details**: Name, resource group

📊 **View metrics**
* Use **Metrics** blade on AI resource to:
   * Add custom charts (e.g., call count, error rate)
   * Export or link charts
* Create **Dashboards** with:
   * Up to 100 tiles combining multiple visualizations
   * Add metric charts directly from resources

🧾 **Manage diagnostic logging**
* Create storage destinations:
   * **Azure Log Analytics** (for querying/log visualization)
   * **Azure Storage** (for archival/export)
* Configure on **Diagnostic settings**:
   * Define name, categories of logs/metrics, destinations
* View diagnostic data:
   * Wait up to 1 hour for data flow
   * Use **Log Analytics** query interface to analyze logs

🧠 **Best Practices / Considerations**
* Use free tier for testing to reduce costs.
* Always create estimates before provisioning.
* Set up alerts for error thresholds and key operations.
* Use dashboards for centralized monitoring.
* Configure diagnostics to send logs to **both Log Analytics and Storage**.
* Ensure storage accounts are in the **same region** as AI resources for latency/cost efficiency.

❓ **Simulated Exam Questions**
1. 🧮 *How can you estimate costs for multiple Azure AI services before deployment?* ➤ Use the **Azure Pricing Calculator**, select services and input expected usage.
2. 💰 *Where can you view the accumulated cost of Azure AI services in the portal?* ➤ Use **Cost Analysis** and filter by service name = "Azure AI Services".
3. 🚨 *What types of signals can trigger an alert rule in Azure AI services?* ➤ **Activity Log** (e.g., key regeneration), **Metric** (e.g., error count > 10).
4. 📊 *How do you add service metrics to a shared view?* ➤ Use **Metrics** → add chart → **Add to Dashboard**.
5. 🛠️ *Which resources must be created before enabling diagnostic logging?* ➤ **Azure Log Analytics** and/or **Azure Storage**.
6. 🔍 *Where can you analyze captured diagnostic data for an AI resource?* ➤ In **Azure Log Analytics**, using query interface.
